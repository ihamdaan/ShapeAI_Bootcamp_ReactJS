        Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in January 2009. It
        follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and
        pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.1 The identity of the person or persons
        who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin offers the
        promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment
        mechanisms and, unlike government-issued currencies, it is operated by a
        decentralized authority. Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. There are
        no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that
        everyone has transparent access to. All bitcoin transactions are
        verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued
        or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins
        valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin is
        very popular and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other
        cryptocurrencies, collectively referred to as altcoins. Bitcoin is
        commonly abbreviated as "BTC."
