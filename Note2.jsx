        Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract
        functionality. Ether (ETH or Îž) is the native cryptocurrency of the
        platform. After Bitcoin, it is the second-largest cryptocurrency by
        market capitalization. Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain.
        Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. In 2014,
        development was crowdfunded, and the network went live with an initial
        supply of 72 million coins on 30 July 2015. The platform allows
        developers to build and operate decentralized applications that users
        can interact with. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a
        broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial
        intermediaries, such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, allowing
        cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out
        for interest.Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of NFTs,
        which are non-interchangeable tokens connected to digital works of art
        or other real-world items and sold.
