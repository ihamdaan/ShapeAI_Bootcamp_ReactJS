        Dogecoin (DOGE) is a peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency. It is
        considered an altcoin and an almost sarcastic meme coin. Launched in
        Dec. 2013, Dogecoin has the image of a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. While
        it was created seemingly as a joke, Dogecoin's blockchain still has
        merit. Its underlying technology is derived from Litecoin. Notable
        features of Dogecoin, which uses a scrypt algorithm, are its low price
        and unlimited supply. Dogecoin started as something of a joke, but after
        it was created, it gained a following. By late 2017, it was
        participating in the cryptocurrency bubble that sent the values of many
        coins up significantly.1﻿ After the bubble burst in 2018, Dogecoin lost
        much of its value, but it still has a core of supporters who trade it
        and use it to tip content on Twitter and Reddit.2﻿ Users can buy and
        sell Dogecoin on digital currency exchanges. They can opt to store their
        Dogecoin on an exchange or in a Dogecoin wallet. The major difference
        between the two is Dogecoin being a so-called “inflationary coin ”. It
        has this distinction due to not having a hard limit on the amount of
        Dogecoin to ever be produced. This means that over time there will be an
        unlimited amount of Dogecoin in circulation.
