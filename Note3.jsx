        Polygon was formerly called Matic Network. Polygon (MATIC) is an
        Ethereum token that powers the Polygon Network, a scaling solution for
        Ethereum. Polygon aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions on
        Ethereum using Layer 2 sidechains, which are blockchains that run
        alongside the Ethereum main chain. Users can deposit Ethereum tokens to
        a Polygon smart contract, interact with them within Polygon, and then
        later withdraw them back to the Ethereum main chain. The MATIC token is
        used to pay transaction fees and participate in proof-of-stake
        consensus. The Matic Polygon coin, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, is
        unaffected by high transaction fees owing to congestion. It's an
        open-source technology that gives developers the tools they need to
        create a stand-alone network or a secure sidechain using smart contracts
        and the Ethereum network's security. Last week, the market
        capitalization of Polygon, which was created by three Indians, surpassed
        $10 billion.The Polygon network aims to be a hub to which different
        blockchains can easily be plugged into and its main chain is Ethereum.
